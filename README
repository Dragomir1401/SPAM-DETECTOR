MAXIMUM LOCAL F1 SCORE WAS 84.94 AND FINAL SUBMISSION HAD A SCORE OF 83.8

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Description~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This project is basically a checker for spam emails considering different
formulas and different standards.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tasks~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


~~~TASK_1~~~
    We have to calculate standard deviation from the average for keywords
appereances in each email given.
~~~TASK_2~~~
    We have to tell if an email is spam based on 3 categories of score:
1. Score based on how many keywords that email contains
2. Score based on if the email contains more than half uppercases in the body
3. Score if the email is sent from an address which is known as ussually spam

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~How to run it~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make && ./spam_detector

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Implementation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    General implementation is based on two structures which hold information
for initial keywords and additional keywords to make score better.

    First task is implemented by iterating through each email in the emails
directory and counting each appereance of each keyword. We need total
appereances and as well as apperenaces per mail to calculate deviation from
the average appereances.

    stdev = sqrt((1 / n) * sum((v[i] - average) ^ 2))

    Second tasks is implemented using a number of array which store values 
of number of characters, number of uppercases, number on new line in a maximum
streak, number of words, spammer information for a given email. We use the
information stored to calculate final score. If score exceeds limit of 35
we may consider that email as a spam.

keywordsScore(mail,keys) = ∑ count(mail, keyword) * (avgSize / len(mail.body))

hasCaps(mail) = (capsCount(mail.body) > 1/2 ∗ len(mail.body)) ? 1 : 0

spammer(mail) = scorul din fisierul spammers pentru adresa de email (mail.from).


score(mail) = 10∗keywordsScore(mail, kwords) + 30∗hasCaps(mail) + spammers(mail)
